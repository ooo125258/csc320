# Computing the Patch Confidence C(p)
#
# Input arguments: 
#    psiHatP: 
#         A member of the PSI class that defines the
#         patch. See file inpainting/psi.py for details
#         on the various methods this class contains.
#         In particular, the class provides a method for
#         accessing the coordinates of the patch center, etc
#    filledImage:
#         An OpenCV image of type uint8 that contains a value of 255
#         for every pixel in image I whose color is known (ie. either
#         a pixel that was not masked initially or a pixel that has
#         already been inpainted), and 0 for all other pixels
#    confidenceImage:
#         An OpenCV image of type uint8 that contains a confidence 
#         value for every pixel in image I whose color is already known.
#         Instead of storing confidences as floats in the range [0,1], 
#         you should assume confidences are represented as variables of type 
#         uint8, taking values between 0 and 255.
#
# Return value:
#         A scalar containing the confidence computed for the patch center
